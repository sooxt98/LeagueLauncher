## Long queue time / No getting any queue / estimated queue with 3:20
Sometimes queue doesnt work and you may get an infinite queue time because of the LeagueClient version mismatched with the server.

So I'll teach you how to upgrade or downgrade the LeagueCLient without Garena:
1. You need to click "update lol" from the launcher's dock icon
2. It will open up another LeagueClient which allows you to downgrade the client version
3. Open up the LeagueClient's settings from the top right corner
4. Click on the version tab, double click on Game Version's number which enables the custom patch GUI
5. Choose the patch which match the current garena LeagueClient's version
