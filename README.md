- A launcher that allows to patch over 28 languages pack with voice over
- Get faster update speed with in-client patch without needing to wait that long lost garena patcher to build manifest file

## Installation

2. Launch your Garena and League, then open the LeagueLauncher and right click the dock icon and click "kill garena"
3. You may now open League of Legends without Garena

## Long queue time / No getting any queue / estimated queue with 3:20
Sometimes queue doesnt work and you may get an infinite queue time because of the LeagueClient version mismatched with the server.

So I'll teach you how to upgrade or downgrade the LeagueCLient without Garena:
1. You need to click "update lol" from the launcher's dock icon
2. It will open up another LeagueClient which allows you to downgrade the client version
3. Open up the LeagueClient's settings from the top right corner
4. Click on the version tab, double click on Game Version's number which enables the custom patch GUI
5. Choose the patch which match the current garena LeagueClient's version

## Garena unable to open back league?
If you change locale before, it will patch some settings which breaks the garena, so use this method to restore the settings
1. Simply click "fix garena" from the launcher's dock icon and try again
